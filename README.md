# Smart-blind-stick-using-Image-captioning.-
There are millions of blind people in this world who always need some help. These visually impared people find it challenging to move independently outside their houses.  The Smart Blind Stick that we will design helps the blind society by providing a better and more convenient means of life by moving around independently. The stick consists of ultrasonic sensors, one camera and an earphone/speaker. This device can detect obstacles in the vicinity of the user up to 400cm in three directions, which are forward, left and right, by using a network of ultrasonic sensors. All the ultrasonic sensors are connected to the raspberry pi. These sensors send signals to raspberry pi for further computation. Raspberry pi computes the distance from the obstacle it alerts the user by triggering the buzzer and by describing the surrounding through the picture captured by the camera. The camera is used for object recognition and the image obtained through the camera will be captioned and presented to the user in the form of audio. The audio will tell what that image is  and what should be done if it is an obstacle; thus, working as a virtual eye for blind people.
